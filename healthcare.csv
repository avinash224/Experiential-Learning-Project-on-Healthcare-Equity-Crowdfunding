healthier lifestyles. 

The company is developing an ultra-compact wireless wearable sensor, called the Fitbit Tracker, that automatically tracks data about a person's activities, such as calories burned, sleep quality, steps and distance.

The Fitbit Tracker collects activity data automatically while it is
worn by the user all day. The collected data is wirelessly uploaded to
a website where the wearer can see their data and track their progress toward personal goals. The website provides a motivational interface where users can share their progress, compare themselves against similar people and work toward virtual goals with their friends, family and
co-workers. At the website, users can also manually log nutrition,
weight and other health information in order to gain a complete
picture of their health.

Healthcare costs in the U.S. simply canât continue to rise at the current rate. Today, health care consumes 17 percent of our economy and that is figure projected to jump to 20 percent within just the next five years.

However, when employers and insurers look for ways to control health care costs, their choices often range from bad (raising co-pays and premiums) to worse (cutting benefits.)

With Health Options Worldwide (HOW), health care payers now have another option, unlike anything that currently exists in the marketplace. Our online healthcare management tools have been proven to reduce costs while actually improving patient satisfaction. 

Clients who work with HOW can expect to:
â¢	Reduce health care costs. In some cases, our system has been shown to reduce surgical costs alone as much as 30 to 50 percent. 
â¢	Improve overall employee health. More than just a cost issue, employee health impacts every aspect of a business, from fewer absences and disability claims to improved performance and productivity.

More than 40 million people in the United States care for someone over age 50, yet most have little preparation or experience when they begin their caregiving journey. To make that journey a little easier, Caring.com provides original articles, helpful tools, advice from more than 50 leading experts, a comprehensive directory of caregiving services, and the collective wisdom of an involved community. Their seasoned executive team, editors, and technical staff have decades of experience producing award-winning health and family media, and nearly all have first-hand experience as caregivers.

Their mission: to help family caregivers make better decisions, save time and money, and feel less alone -- and less stressed -- as they face the many challenges of caregiving.

More than 40 million people in the United States care for someone over age 50, yet most have little preparation or experience when they begin their caregiving journey. To make that journey a little easier, Caring.com provides original articles, helpful tools, advice from more than 50 leading experts, a comprehensive directory of caregiving services, and the collective wisdom of an involved community. Their seasoned executive team, editors, and technical staff have decades of experience producing award-winning health and family media, and nearly all have first-hand experience as caregivers.

Caring.com has a similar model to [BabyCenter](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/babycenter). Two of the founders, Jim Scott and Steve Fram, spent eight years at BabyCenter. 

Caring.com seems to offer more specific and tailored information in an age-related context than the [Eons](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/eons) social network for those over 50.

Our first service offering is Massage On Demand®, launched April 2, 2013.

 Massage On Demand® is growing at nearly 50% monthly in 1st test market (NYC) and disrupting the $15B US and $80B global massage market.

Our Zeel apps allow customers to get same-day massage in the privacy of home, hotel, or office in as little as an hour. They choose between a soothing Swedish and invigorating deep tissue massage. Customers pay a set price (including tax & tip), charged to their credit card on file. All therapists are handpicked and vetted in person, licensed in their state of practice, insured (minimum of $1M), and deliver superior massage experiences (or they dont stay in the network). Therapists access appointments and see payments via a proprietary app that tracks their availability and location via GPS technology.

Its a little like magic, thanks to our talented programmers, ""zeelous"" customer service reps and passionate ops team.

In September 2013, Zeel launched Massage Zeelot, the first-ever same-day, on-demand massage subscription service. Customers receive at least one in-home, on-demand Zeel Massage per month at a preferred rate, along with a free professional-grade massage table, theirs to keep. Because Zeelots have tables, Zeel Massage Therapists quickly arrive to soothe and unwind them.

Our first product, DietBet, is a game that brings people together to lose weight. Players bet into the pot and commit to lose 4% of their starting weight in 4 weeks (DietBet 4) or 10% in 6 months (DietBet 10). Everyone who reaches the goal splits the pot. By making weight loss collaborative, competitive, and fun, we've transformed a dull chore into a fun community activity.

The results have been extraordinary -- over 90% of players lose weight. Since we launched in Jan 2013, we've paid out over $2 million to people who have reached their weight loss goals with our platform (on average winners lose about 9 pounds a month).

Harvard Med School professor Nicholas Christakis has said that obesity is a social disease that requires a social solution. We agree. In addition to developing new products, DietBetter is working with Brown Medical School's Weight Control and Diabetes Research Center to build a scientific foundation around our Social Dieting solution.

Innovative Labs LLC was founded in 2007 by John Webley, a successful businessman with a proven record of accomplishment in the technology industry. The mission of Innovative Labs is to solve environmental challenges that affect global well-being. Innovative Labs focused on a problem and engineered a solution. Webley and his team of engineers and scientists developed a unique Photocatalytic Oxidation (PCO) air purification system and Manganese Oxide (MnOx) air purification system which had been designed to address the concerns of formaldehyde, ozone and VOC pollution. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) challenged scientists to develop air purification technology for trailers supplied by FEMA to house many of the displaced residents of New Orleans.  These trailers were exposing occupants to high levels of formaldehyde and other VOCs off-gassing from the composite wood and other materials used in trailer construction. FEMA, NASA, and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conducted tests of the Sonoma Air purifier against thirteen (13) other air purification units. The Sonoma Air purifier excelled, yielding a very high single pass conversion of formaldehyde and other VOCs, without emitting ozone.  Innovative Labs is a company driven to solve air quality problems while making a positive impact on society. 

Innovative Labs has since taken the technology from the FEMA trailers, and developed air filters to be used in central HVAC systems of hotels, hospitals, businesses and green building construction.","formaldehyde, indoor-air-quality, clean-air-technology, top-rated-air-purifiers, highest-rated-air-purifiers, best-air-cleaner","USA","CA","petaluma","SF Bay","","",0,0,"2011-12-01","2012-01-09",2,6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The great improvements in medicine in the coming decades will come from increasingly data-driven diagnostics, naming, and treatments. This involves collecting data and building models. We want to empower people to be the architects of the models, while we take care of the construction and provide the materials.

As genomics and other data-intensive technologies are adopted in biomedical research, biological data analysts are increasingly repeating the costly and time-consuming tasks of setting up computing infrastructure. Bioinformaticians spend at least 30% of their time finding, parsing, and formatting publicly available datasets to integrate them with new data. We've automated much of this and are working for bioinformaticians to make programming medical data easier.

Having conducted prospective DSPA testing on tens of thousands of patients since 2009, Strand Diagnostics has documented that approximately 1% of cases receiving a positive cancer diagnosis are subject to undetected tissue transposition or contamination which could lead to a cancer diagnosis being assigned to the wrong patient. Including the complimentary patients who, therefore, may have received a false negative diagnosis, this means that up to 2% of all tissue biopsies could result in an incorrect diagnosis unless DSPA testing is incorporated into the diagnostic testing cycle.

Available for a diverse range of tissue types, the know error® system brings new levels of patient safety and accuracy to the diagnostic testing cycle for breast, prostate, and other cancers. Since the company's launch in 2009, hundreds of physicians in a variety of specialties, including urology, radiology, GI, and oncology, have adopted the know error® system as their standard of patient care for diagnosing patients with cancer.","","USA","IN","Indianapolis","Indianapolis","2012-03-28","2012-03-28",1,30000000,"","",0,1,"2012-03-28","series-a","a",30000000,1,1,1

We wanted to build a tool that will allow people tell stories about their healthy lifestyle choices, and so inspire others to get active and healthy.

Sweatdrops has designed a way to identify, track, and measure all the actions and behaviors associated with your fitness life story (FLS), and a simple mobile user interface to help you tell it. We define your FLS as the end-to-end experience across all your healthy activities. Specifically, your FLS is made up of 5 components: your personal progress, your accomplishments, the progress of others, the support you offer others, and community recognition.

Currently, there is no single tool to track or share your FLS. Despite the technology available, avid runners and cyclists still write emails and send texts to each other to share information, motivate each other, and brag. Our team (made of athletes) feels this gap and has decided to build a tool specifically for people interested in sharing their FLS with each other. In the process, we developed a system to reward positive behaviors and activities, to further inspire (and incentivize) people to continue their healthy activities.

Sweatdrops recognizes that fitness lifestyle is split into activity verticals, but within activities, there are similar patterns in the way that we interact with our communities and in the information that we share. Your FLS is full of rich data, allowing us to recommend activities and products, according to patterns in your behavior. 

Our two big disruptions are: 1) that the FLS framework can be applied across activity verticals (ex: running, cycling, yoga) to address the fundamental needs of people who are passionate about fitness and 2) that the sharing currently taking place on email lists, text, Facebook can now take place on one convenient mobile app.

To enable the measurement of your FLS, weve created a measurement system for tracking, sharing, and rewarding all actions across your fitness storya common currency represented by sweat drops. Whether you go for a swim, upload a picture of a cross-fit class, or check in to a local juice bar with a friend, your actions will be earning sweat drops. They will act as a numeric representation of your FLS and will be redeemable for discounts on products and services. Committed and aspiring fitness enthusiasts love public recognition, but we believe they love rewards even more. There are multiple incentives to engage with the app.

Knife-edge scanning, introduced in the KESM instrument, not only preserves image registration throughout the depth of the specimen block but also isolates the tissue above the knife from that below to eliminate undesirable events (back-scattering of light and bleaching of fluorescent-stained tissue below the knife). Knife-edge scanning supports all known forms of microscopy (absorption imaging using transmitted light, and reflected light imaging using bright-field, dark-field, DIC, and GFP fluorescence). Using the KESM, 3Scan is able to scan a one cc^3 block of tissue (for example, a whole mouse brain) at submicron resolution in under 100 hours. With this resolution (a voxel size of 0.6 um x 0.7 um x 1.0 um) 3Scan is able to show cell scale phenomena in the context of a compete organ. In the example of a whole mouse brain this means that 3Scan is able to accurately model every neuron in the mouse brain sample.

3Scan currently utilizes this amazingly accurate imaging technology to advance the fields of drug discovery, connectomics, and medical devices, there are many more applications of this exciting technology.While 3Scan is a for profit company we care more about interesting projects than profit margins. If you are working on something that would benefit from 3Scans unique imaging technique please do not hesitate to contact us about collaborating!","","USA","CA","San Francisco","SF Bay","2012-04-23","2012-04-23",1,350000,"","",0,0,"2012-04-23","other","grant",350000,1,1,1

PTs can film their own personalized exercise videos and upload them to RevoPT on one device--their smartphone. They can build and organize their own personal library and assign video to patients to build truly individualized home exercise programs.

Patients access the videos assigned to them on any desktop or mobile device. They are also held accountable by a tracking system that sends them reminders, logs their exercise completion, and asks them for subjective data about their progress with rehabilitation.  All of this information is relayed to their physical therapist so that adjustments can be made to the program accordingly.

The company is currently in Beta testing and was chosen as one of nine companies to participate in the StartFast Venture Accelerator Program.  The program takes place from May 14-August 16 in Syracuse, NY this summer.

The Authority Behind My Diabetes Home
My Diabetes Home was created by Anuj Bhargava, MD, MBA,CDE, FACP, FACE, an endocrinologist and founder of the Iowa Diabetes and Endocrinology Research Center (www.iderc.org).
 
Dr. Bhargava has devoted his career to defeating diabetes and is passionate about helping people with diabetes live better lives. This passion developed years ago, after Dr. Bhargava watched his favorite uncle die from diabetes complications. I was 14 and his death had a major impact on me, said Dr. Bhargava. I also saw how hard it was for his family, especially his children. He was only in his 40s when he died of a heart attack, because he did not take care of his diabetes or his health. 
 
My Diabetes Home is part of Dr. Bhargavas ongoing mission to improve the health and lives of people affected by diabetes. In addition to Dr. Bhargava, My Diabetes Home is staffed by a team of other health care professionals, including registered dietitians, pharmacists and certified diabetes educators.

In close cooperation with top doctors and researchers around the world, 360imaging continues to develop the 360imaging solution, a complete solution for all implant treatment needs. The 360imaging solution draws upon our years of experience, expertise and innovation in the field making it the most perfect and complete solution for doctor needs. 

360imaging solution includes the following set of integrated products and services: 

- 360dps: An intuitive and easy to use treatment planning software for accurate and predictable planning of implant cases. 

- Surgical Guides: The most affordable surgical guides for every case scenario. Manufactured and designed in USA, cutting down delivery time in half. 

- Digital Lab Service: Offering complete Implant-related service such as Radiology Reports, Conversion & Image Modeling and Customized Treatment Planning services.


Company History:
360imaging® opened its doors for business in 2005, with the initial goal of building 3D CT imaging centers for the dental community across the United States. After opening two centers in Atlanta and one Preferred Scan Center in Athens, GA and one in Charlotte, NC, we realized the need to offer our dental practice clients Digital Lab service after each patient scan.

In order to best serve our dental practice clients, we decided to pursue the development of the 360 Digital Lab, that offered complete Implant treatment related services including Radiology Reports, Conversion and Image Modeling and Treatment Planning services.

After planning over 30,000 cases over 6 years, we saw the shortcomings of the software packages on the market and saw an opportunity to simplify the planning process through a superior software option that would work with any type of implant. That led to the development of 360dps; a comprehensive, cost-effective and intuitive implant planning software designed to make implant planning painless. 

In addition, the backups and delays on surgical guides coming from overseas were a constant problem. In response, we have developed a state-of-the-art technology to produce surgical guides here in Atlanta, GA. This technology allows us to produce guides in half the time of guides that are produced overseas, letting practitioners complete cases faster and increasie cash flow.","digital-dentistry, medical-imaging, symbyo, implantology, dentistry","USA","GA","Atlanta","Atlanta","2005-01-01","2010-01-01",2,5500000,"","",0,4,"2005-01-01","angel","seed",500000,0,0,1

The website, www.CareXtend.com, launched in Illinois on Monday, July 16, 2012.

CareXtend is changing the face of the healthcare industry. With just a few clicks, consumers can browse based on their zip code or care need to find great offers on healthcare related products and services. The site delivers a personalized experience with an easy display of all past purchases, ability to customize views, quick access to account information, and a snapshot of estimated savings from purchases. CareXtend is not a deal of the day site; its offers remain active for an extended period of time to give consumers affordable access to the care they need, when they need it.

CareXtend users will spend less on a broad range of healthcare offerings such as dental, chiropractic care, acupuncture, dermatology, cosmetic surgery, vision including Lasik, hearing, adult and childhood nutrition and weight loss, travel immunizations, podiatry, autism therapies, and over-the-counter medicines. CareXtend provides health and wellness offerings in the following three categories:
 
-Care Vouchers give users a great one-time savings on services at a 20-60% discounted rate (e.g. acupuncture, skin care, nutrition/weight loss and foot care).

-Discount Programs provide users with exclusive pricing for recurring products and services throughout the year (e.g. dental, vision, over-the-counter medications and hearing). 

-Subscription Services offer consumers and their families access to services that help manage and improve their health (e.g. 24-hour nursing, funeral planning, senior care search services, health related financial advice and health/lifestyle coaching). 

For consumers who contribute to a Health Savings Account (HSA) or Flexible Spending Account (FSA), CareXtend identifies those products and services that are eligible for a deduction from these accounts.

According to the Consumer Expenditure Survey 2010, Americans spend nearly $220 billion every year on products and services not covered by health insurance. Even with a good health plan, an average individual spends nearly $2,000 per year while a family can spend upwards of $3,500. The current marketplace for health and wellness products and services is highly fragmented giving consumers limited resources to reduce their spending.

Many consumers are faced with high deductibles and large out-of-pocket expenses for non-covered services with limited online resources to help mitigate the costs, says Marc Pierce, CEO of CareXtend. CareXtend is the solution and will revolutionize the way people go about purchasing health and wellness products and services. We are confident CareXtend will be a success and plan to expand to 15 states in the next two years.
 
The recent passing of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) only further illuminates the need for CareXtend. Under this legislation, Americans are required to carry health insurance by 2014 or pay a penalty. For Americans who decide to obtain coverage, many will choose a high deductible plan and will face significant out-of-pocket healthcare expenses. For those who decide to forego health insurance and pay the mandated tax, they will still need access to affordable care. In addition, the creation of online exchanges, where individuals and employers will go to shop for health insurance, will exponentially increase the number of consumers shopping online for health and wellness products and services. 

CareXtend exclusively offers health and wellness products and services, and partners with reputable healthcare providers that hold valid state licenses and comply with HIPAA requirements.

Further, the spread of these aggressive strains cannot be geophysically monitored to track epidemiological trends (bioinformatics).

To solve these problems, BioNanovations is currently developing a handheld, integrated real-time diagnostic platform which decreases the diagnostic time of Staph. infections from 3-5 days to under 30 minutes. By enabling real-time bacterial diagnostics, our platform enables immediate transmission of diagnostic metadata thus creating a new market for real-time bioinformatics.

Codagenix presents a breakthrough approach to live-attenuated vaccine design- were no longer would a vaccine developer blindly passage their target virus to construct a vaccine.  The SAVE platform relies on synthetic biology and the re-designing of a target viruss entire genome to yield a vaccine strain (Coleman JR. Science 2008; Muller SM. Nature Biotechnology 2010).  This customization process uses software-based algorithms to re-code the genome of a target virus.  This genomic re-coding results in a virus that is antigenically 100% identical (i.e. looks exactly like the wild-type, virulent strain) but possesses a genome that renders it attenuated in the host.  The proteins of the SAVE-designed vaccine strain are one hundred percent identical to the virulent strain and as a result animals vaccinated with SAVE-designed vaccines develop a robust and protective immune response.   SAVE is a platform technology that has had preliminary success constructing vaccine candidates for multiple, unrelated targets viruses.  SAVE is an up-stream approach to vaccine construction.  The science behind the SAVE re-design targets a fundamental process of all viruses and thus it is viewed as platform that could yield a pipeline of candidate vaccine strains against multiple targets that include: Influenza A virus, Dengue Virus, Respiratory Syncytial virus, poliovirus, and others.

The first candidate virus in our pipeline is a live-attenuated Influenza A virus vaccine (LAIV), particularly the seasonal 2009 H1N1 Influenza A virus (referred to as swine flu).  This candidate of our pipeline has been initially supported by a small business grant for $551,000 from the NIH that is eligible for $3.5 million based on success.  Despite the availability of seasonal vaccines, Influenza still has a substantial impact on human health.  Based on our approach and preclinical findings, Codagenix has the view that once in the market a SAVE-designed LAIV will prove superior to currently available seasonal flu vaccines.  Aside from Influenza spreading around the world in seasonal epidemics, killing thousands of people annually, there is also a fear of a pandemic arising from an avian H5N1strain.  An additional view of Codagenix is that SAVE can offer a rapid design of a highly immunogenic, anti-H5N1 vaccine should the need arise. The majority of seasonal Influenza A vaccines currently in the market at present are mostly composed of inactivated (killed) virus particles that can result in a inadequate immune response.  There is an ever-growing demand in the market for influenza vaccines, thus an improved LAIV could capture significant market share of what is estimated to be a $6 billion market. In the US this market has been growing with compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19% and it is projected to retain a CAGR of 9% until 2015, at which the total market value would reach $15 billion. 

The current business plan of Codagenix has two focuses  to prepare our LAIV for clinical testing and to further demonstrate that SAVE is a platform technology for vaccine development by expanding our pre-clinical pipeline to include other targets such as Dengue virus and RSV.

Our target clients are hospitals, surgery centers, sterile processing facilities and medical device manufacturers within the United States, South America, UK, Europe, Asia and Australia, that utilize and reprocess reusable surgical instrumentation. Depending on the facility, our patent pending products and method has shown up to a 60% improvement in efficiency on surgical tray assembly times. Additional benefits include reduced potential for surgical site infections, increased instrument/asset accountability, decreased breakage due to poor care and handling, elimination of disposable wraps and accessories, and standardization of terminal sterilization packaging which will reduce poor outcomes associated with processing variability.

There are approximately 6000 hospitals and 5000 surgery centers in the U.S. With the passing of the Affordable Care act in 2010, these health systems are increasingly focused on cost cutting initiatives. Reducing the inefficiency and waste which has been exponentially stressing our health care system enables hospitals to administer more affective care to more people. It is our mission to focus on products and techniques that will promote a higher level of efficiency and productivity enabling our nations hospitals to deliver quality healthcare to all. Historically there are many know challenges that center on the logistical aspects to performing surgery. Many of these known challenges are focused around the decontamination, inspection and re-assembly process of the reusable devices used in surgery. RMS has identified this as a cost saving area for most of our nations hospitals utilizing our patent pending products/method.

Large amounts of sequence, such as whole genomes of various strains of a pathogen or human genomic regions from multiple patients, are compared. Patterns of interest, such those that separate drug-resistant from non-resistant pathogens or one type of patient from another, are identified and corresponding assays are generated in a single automated step. The format and properties of the desired assay are an input to the process, and for example may be a set of oligonucleotides for an array or a minimal set of PCR primers within a provided melting temperature range. The candidate designs from the software can then be manually curated and the best candidates tested in the lab. The simplicity of the process reduces time and costs compared to standard assay R&D practices, allowing us to efficiently execute a broad range of projects on a fee-for-service basis.","","USA","WI","Madison","Madison","2013-03-21","2013-03-21",1,150000,"","",0,0,"2013-03-21","venture","unattributed",150000,1,1,1

With it, we will empower society with information to track the spread of disease, and simultaneously transform the way people care for their children, families and communities. 

Our first product is a low-cost smartphone-connected thermometer. It allows us to communicate with people who have just fallen ill. The worlds smartest thermometer, it does not simply tell you your temperature, rather it transform the way you care for your family. You can track your symptoms with a few simple taps to show your doctor later, view the health weather in the local area or at your child's school, and know whether it's strep or flu going around, or book a medical appointment. It is also a better thermometer. We designed it specifically with children and parents in mind. Using the smartphone's display, we have created an engaging experience potentially making it easier to take a sick child's temperature. 

Members of our team previously built international health programs that put more than 2 million people onto life-saving treatments and started successful technology ventures.

More importantly, iF provides a solution for consumers who are overwhelmed with the abundance of competing nutritional claims, all clamoring for their attention. The consumer wants to know, what to eat in support of their specific health and wellness goals.

The centerpiece of the Formulary is the ability of a user, who has identified (via an easy to use menu) their health and wellness goals, to derive explicit, unbiased and customized nutritional recommendations.  Once a visitor has provided their health goals, our patent-pending Efficacy Engine force ranks ingredients and supplements that correlate with the underlying condition and goals as itemized by the consumer. Each of these ingredients is ranked by offering their relative value (A-F) and buttressed by immediately callable clinical studies that document each claim(s). Co-morbidities (if relevant) for each VMS product are highlighted to enable the consumer to understand that a product appropriate for one condition may be contraindicated for another. The consumer is presented with a full ingredient breakdown of both natural and commercial products which contain these ingredients that best support their stated health objectives. 

iF is the honest broker in this process, the Efficacy Engine wont rank one product over another on any criteria other than the science.  We have no dog in this fight, no private-label line were extolling.  Armed with the data, the consumer can decide a) what to order and b) do so in an Amazon tier fulfillment environment.  

In concert with iFormularys recruited channel partners (health & fitness clubs, health/condition advocacy associations, health insurance plans & providers, education), our partner and their client derive a service viewed as high value.  Our channel partner receives a profit share, augmenting their revenue stream with no incremental expense, other than working with iF to direct and incentivize their client base to the merit of the iF website and service, without a subscription expense for the consumer.
 
The iF leadership team is committed to demonstrate our model in a launch channel of Health & Fitness Clubs. Fifty million consumers are regular patrons of a health club.  Health Club patrons purchase an average of $263/year of VMS and nutritional foods. More than half of these purchases are made online via a variety of outlets (COSTCO, GNC, Vitamin Shoppe, etc.).  With the opportunity to enjoy diminished health/fitness club dues and a robust loyalty program, a dominant percentage of these patrons (survey of 5k members across 10 clubs) indicated their willingness to switch to iFormulary. By partnering with fitness chains and operators, we augment site revenue due to the profit share we provide from e-Commerce activity with their patrons.

The companys proprietary technology platform enables the discovery and development of superior antibody product candidates that are able to impact previously inaccessible disease mechanisms.

While many companies are working to develop antibody therapies based on mouse- or human-derived antibody technologies, Apexigen is pioneering a movement into therapeutics based on rabbit-derived humanized monoclonal antibodies as a means of providing therapeutic benefits that have not been achieved through the use of other technologies.

Several blockbuster antibody drugs have been developed with existing mouse and human antibody technologies and display libraries. However, the development of the next generation of antibody-based drugs will require capabilities that exceed those of current technologies in order to bind rare or intractable antigen epitopes and to exert novel effects on disease processes. The key to these next generation therapeutics lies in harnessing the inherent advantages of rabbit antibodies, which have been used successfully in research settings for decades. These advantages are the result of rabbits ability to generate a much greater diversity of unique high quality antibodies - with high affinity, high specificity and which bind unique antigen epitopes. These attributes enable the discovery of antibodies that are capable of targeting previously unreachable disease mechanisms.","","USA","CA","Burlingame","SF Bay","2013-08-06","2013-08-06",1,20000000,"","",0,0,"2013-08-06","series-a","a",20000000,5,1,1

However, there are only 21,000 organ transplants performed each year. A severe shortage of organ donors combined with an aging population means that the number of people expected to die while waiting for a life-saving transplant will increase dramatically. Ex-vivo organ perfusion is a groundbreaking technology and process poised to transform the transplant industry over the next 10 years and significantly reduce the wait for an organ transplant.

PERFUSIX is the world's first and only commercial provider of ex-vivo organ perfusion services. PERFUSIX employs clinically proven ex-vivo organ perfusion technology and processes that restore and improve the function of donor organs.

Diminishing agricultural resources such as arable land and fresh water will further compound this challenge.In the last twenty years, crop yields have improved from intensive breeding programs, increased planting densities, and biotech traits such as insect resistance and herbicide tolerance.

One contributing factor to the decline in crop development is that nearly all commercial biotech traits are single-gene approaches to protecting yield.

Orgenesis employs a molecular and cellular approach directed at converting liver cells into functional insulin-producing cells as a treatment for diabetes. This new therapeutic approach is called Autologous Insulin Producing (AIP) cell transplantation.

Beta cell replacement is one of the most promising approaches for treatment of Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (IDDM). Currently, pancreas islet transplantation is the only approved cell replacement technology and it's the best available treatment for diabetics. However, it's impractical because of a shortage of donor tissue and rejection rate by the patient' immune system. Orgenesis believes that converting the diabetic patients own tissue to insulin producing cells will overcome the problem of donor shortage. Moreover, since the diabetic patient serves as his/her own donor, there is no risk of transplant rejection.

Orgenesis has manifested promising results in in-vitro and in-vivo studies using human liver tissues. Based on this significant discovery and these findings, Orgenesis has designed an efficient and clear work-plan to initiate clinical testing in the next few months allowing the company to launch phase I clinical trials following FDA guidelines followed by the launch of Phase II clinical trials within a year.","","USA","NY","WHITE PLAINS","New York","2013-05-14","2013-05-14",1,1300000,"","",0,4,"2013-05-14","private-equity","private_equity",1300000,0,1,1

Early on, we conceptualized secure messaging as a means to an end and have partnered with industry thought leaders to create a first-in-class product. 

Quarc is a Web-portal and Smartphone application that significantly improves the process of clinical paging. Currently, communication breakdowns cause 60-70% of the 200,000 fatal medical errors that occur each year in the U.S. Whats more, the available paging solutions feed into this problem as 1 in 7 pages is sent to the wrong individual, and over 30% of pages go unanswered within 15 minutes of being sent. 

To combat this growing issue, Quarc uses its message prioritization and routing feature to ensure that a message is not only delivered to the appropriate individual, but also that it is acted on in an appropriate length of time. Quarc also includes an advanced analytics suite, designed to identify outlier cases and predict if and when a medical error is likely to happen. Through the use of MEDarchons Quarc system, you will create an environment of: fewer interruptions, fewer errors, enhanced communication, enhanced workflow, and lower data risk.","","USA","TN","Nashville","Nashville","2013-05-03","2013-05-03",1,225000,"","",0,1,"2013-05-03","venture","partial",225000,0,1,1

It is currently developing solutions for the indication Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). The fungus Pneumocystis commonly resides in the lungs of healthy individuals, but the infection PCP does not arise until a persons immune system is depressed at which time the Pneumocystis pathogens can replicate and cause an infection. PCP is the most common opportunistic infection in HIV/AIDS patients. It also affects other immunocompromised patients including those less than two years of age and over seventy years of age and those undergoing cancer treatment, immunosuppression for organ transplant surgery, corticosteroid treatment, or other immunosuppressive therapy.After infection occurs, PCP has a high mortality rate.

MiniVaxs lead product candidate is a monoclonal antibody (PCP-Antibody) for the treatment of PCP. For those patients already suffering from PCP that are plagued by an average mortality rate of 20%, PCP-Antibody will provide an immediate defense against PC by delivering the antibodies needed to fight off the infection and thereby reducing the risk of mortality.

A follow on product is a novel vaccine (PCP-Vaccine) for the prevention of PCP. PCP-Vaccine promotes the development of long term anti-Pneumocystis antibodies in patients receiving the vaccine. The antibodies help immunocompromised patients prevent Pneumocystis infection and, therefore, prevent PCP development. Similar to childhood vaccinations, one multi-dose regimen of PCP-Vaccine will be needed to confer lifetime protection.

In addition to the therapeutic antibody and vaccine, MiniVax is developing a diagnostic (PCP-Diagnostic) for the detection of a Pneumocystis infection. Currently, clinical diagnosis of PCP is limited to immunohistochemistry and examination of chest X-rays, which have limited sensitivity, specificity, and speed. It takes a highly experienced physician to diagnose PCP. PCP-Diagnostic will provide a quick and accurate means of diagnosing PCP, thus ensuring that the appropriate treatment is prescribed in a timely manner.

The preliminary technology for MiniVaxs PCP products was developed by Dr. Jay Kolls and Dr. Mingquan Zheng at Louisiana State University Health and Science Center (LSUHSC). Drs. Kolls and Zheng initially studied an immunogenic protein in Pneumocystis called Kexin, which provided protection against Pneumocystis in initial animal studies. Approximately five years and $4 million were spent in the lab developing this technology before MiniVax became operational in mid-2011. Currently, MiniVax is further developing the technology through federal and state grants.","","USA","LA","NEW ORLEANS","New Orleans","2013-05-02","2013-05-02",1,110000,"","",0,3,"2013-05-02","venture","partial",110000,0,1,1

DisperSol possesses a unique portfolio of technologies for the production of solubility enhanced systems that includes DisperSols proprietary KinetiSol technology. As a non-solvent, fusion-based process that minimizes thermal stress with highly efficient mixing, KinetiSol is uniquely positioned to generate amorphous solid dispersion systems with the most challenging APIs and with the broadest spectrum of pharmaceutical polymers. DisperSol has established a rapid KinetiSol feasibility program whereby the applicability of the process to any NCE can be determined rapidly and with relatively little API. Following a successful KinetiSol feasibility program, DisperSol is positioned to provide formulations development and manufacturing services to support pre-clinical and early-phase clinical studies. Toward the development of solubility enhanced formulations in general, DisperSol offers a variety of services including: formulation/process research and development for fusion and solvent-based processes, solid-state and chemical characterization, accelerated stability testing, in-vitro/in-vivo performance analysis, drug product manufacturing for pre-clinical and early-phase clinical studies, as well as formulation and process development consulting.

The Company was established by experienced specialty pharmaceutical executives with a successful track record of acquiring, developing, registering, and marketing pharmaceutical products in the US.

Evoke has concentrated on the gastroenterology field due to the significant unmet medical needs, the opportunity to improve known products and its focused physician base. Despite the relatively high number of patients suffering from gastrointestinal diseases and disorders, there are only about 12,000 gastroenterologists in the U.S. These physicians conduct over 31 million patient visits and write almost 40 million prescriptions each year valued at $4.8 billion. Also, GI diseases may limit or alter the effectiveness of traditional oral therapies due to the disease for which the product is intended to treat. By developing enhanced versions of currently approved drug products, through novel delivery formats or formulations, Evoke intends to provide patients additional treatment options.

Evoke's lead product candidate, EVK-001, is in late stage clinical testing. The company has exclusive rights to a novel formulation and delivery of a currently marketed GI product. The product is intended for the treatment of diabetic gastroparesis.

Evoke has advanced its product development activities by leveraging several corporate relationships with many external clinical, CMC, and regulatory experts. Evoke plans to continue this strategy of developing acquired products in partnership with various global organizations depending upon new acquisitions and appropriate asset investment.

The 15th and 16th Centuries marked the beginning of the Age of Exploration, a time of bold action, vast territorial expansion and profound intellectual discovery. Gerardus Mercator (1512-1594), a mathematician and cartographer, played a key role in these ventures. He was as important to navigation as Copernicus was to astronomy. He perfected a map projection that was the first to represent the spherical surface of the earth in two dimensions. The Mercator Projection effectively transformed navigation, making it possible for ships to deliver cargo safely to any port on the globe.

Inspired by the spirit of our namesake, Mercator MedSystems has developed a medical technology that enables the safe and accurate delivery of therapies anywhere in the body, ranging from drugs for diseased blood vessels, to stem cells that regenerate ailing tissues and organs. We believe this breakthrough will allow the expansion of medical therapy and stimulate profound intellectual exploration into new treatments for disease.

Clear Vascular, Inc. (CVI) is a clinical stage company that was formed in 2005 by Drs. Gilbert Gonzales (CEO) and has been supported by equity and equity-sparing funding .  The Company's aims are to image and treat vulnerable plaque and other vascular inflammatory diseases.  The tin-117m based products have been developed under the Initiative for Proliferation Prevention (IPP) program in collaboration with the US Department of Energy and Brookhaven National Laboratory initially using reactors in Russia.  This early work validated the imaging and therapeutic effects predicted for tin-117m.

 

Under this IPP program a proton accelerator method of producing the tin-117m at higher specific activities was then developed in collaboration with the Institute for Nuclear Research near to Moscow.  This production method has been demonstrated to be transferable to a number of institutions in the USA and elsewhere where the product could be made at will.

 

Innovative work by Dr. Nigel Stevenson led to a new tin-117m production method using alpha particles and a cadmium-116 target.  This is now the primary method that is routinely used to manufacture the tin for the clinical trial product. 

 

In conjunction with this, the development of our primary product, Tin-Annexin, has led to numerous pre-clinical and clinical trials that have demonstrated the viability of not only imaging the vulnerable plaque but, more importantly, therapeutically treating the condition.

Currently, drug development relies heavily on animal testing for predicting efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics in humans. This is problematic for several reasons. Testing in animals is expensive and fraught with ethical concerns. Most importantly, the results obtained with animals often don't translate to humans. About ninety percent of all newly developed drugs that have passed animal testing fail during clinical trials! This high attrition rate late in the development process presents a tremendous economic burden on the pharmaceutical industry, and has led to an enormous demand for cheaper and more predictive test assays. The European Union and the United States have launched large initiatives for substituting animal testing with chip-like disposable assays that contain small segments of human tissue, grown in vitro from human cell sources. These new in vitro systems are anticipated to become the 21st century standard tools for the testing of drugs, vaccines, toxic compounds, cosmetics, and warfare countermeasures.

Nortis has pioneered techniques for the in vitro creation of human tissues and organs in disposable chip-like devices, in conjunction with sophisticated control systems for managing experimental conditions and assay read outs. The critical innovation in these devices is a living microvasculature engineered from human vascular cells. These vessels are grown in a tissue-like matrix and are capable of circulatory fluid flow through the inner lumen. When vascular growth hormones are added, the tissue-engineered vessels begin to sprout and form new capillary networks similar to sprouting vessels in human tissues. These vascularized network systems can be used as a starting point for creating a large variety of models of human tissues and organs. Currently, Nortis is developing assays for the evaluation of neuropharmaceuticals, angiogenesis-modulating drugs and drugs that inhibit tumor metastasis. Model systems of the human liver, lung, kidney, lymph node, brain and testis are in the pipeline.","","USA","WA","Seattle","Seattle","2013-03-27","2013-03-27",1,427500,"","",0,1,"2013-03-27","angel","seed",427500,0,1,1

However, we are not a stem cell company. We are a regenerative medicine company whose technologies optimize the biodistribution and clinical utility of exogenously delivered stem cells and naturally-occurring endogenous stem cells.

Our breakthrough products provide solutions to conditions with high unmet medical needs, including enhanced stem cell delivery technologies for regenerative medicine applications and accelerated recovery following cancer chemo/radiotherapy and hematopoietic SCT, and improved general biologic manufacturing methods to overcome resistance issues (Better Biologics) and enable patient-specific biologics (Boutique Biologics) for personalized medicine that eliminate immunogenicity, and improve the biodistribution and bioavailability of biologic therapies.

Despite the promise and potential of stem cell technologies to save lives and improve health outcomes, stem cell therapies still face a number of challenges. One of the most critical challenges is the retention rate of stem cells in the target organ. Clinical trials have demonstrated less than 10% retention, with the majority of injected cells migrating to other areas, primarily the spleen and lymph nodes.

AVM has developed patent-pending approaches that downregulate stem cell binding in the spleen and lymphatic system, and redirect stem cells to the target organ, enabling a potentially dramatic improvement in the safety and efficacy of stem cell therapies.

Conversely, we are developing other novel approaches that upregulate stem cell binding in the spleen and lymphatic system to accelerate recovery and prevent infections following cancer chemo/radiotherapy and stem cell transplants.

Our objective is to develop and advance game-changing technologies that enable stem cells to have a significant impact in the clinical setting while providing a sustainable business model.

Healthcare is constantly changing and evolving, as new and better ways of providing patient care are helping to save lives and improve the quality of life for those in need. Critical Diagnostics is a company on the cutting edge of this change, focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of novel biomarkers in cardiovascular diseases.

Our lead product, the Presage® ST2 Assay, has received FDA clearance and is CE Marked in Europe. This simple, non-invasive test measures for soluble ST2 in the blood, which can aid physicians in risk assessment of heart failure patients.

Soluble ST2 has now been published in more than 100 peer-reviewed articles and scientific posters studying more than 36,000 patients. These clinical studies have demonstrated that high levels of soluble ST2 are predictive of adverse patient outcomes and death in a broad spectrum of cardiovascular disease. They have further shown that the prognostic information from soluble ST2 is independent and provides added information to the cardiac biomarkers commonly used today, including the natriuretic peptides, BNP and NT-proBNP.



Critical Diagnostics was founded in 2004. The Company licensed intellectual property discovered in 2002 at Brigham and Women's Hospital relating to ST2, for which it now holds the exclusive worldwide rights.

Episode payment programs, also referred to as Bundled Payment Programs by the CMS Innovation program, represent an important advance in the organization and financing of health care services.

The Remedy Partners solution empowers health care providers to develop and operate patient-centric episode of care payment programs leading to improved clinical outcomes, lower costs and increased patient satisfaction. Remedy and its provider partners achieve these results through a combination of enhanced financial incentives, sophisticated analytics and health intelligence, a robust technology and communications platform, and collaborative relationships with participating providers.

Remedy was founded by individuals and organizations with a long history in developing episode programs, caring for patients, building health insurance, health care service and I.T. organizations. We trace our roots to the first ever large-scale episode initiative at Oxford Health Plans in the mid 1990s. Our team also includes executives from HealthMarket, a commercial insurance episode program launched in 2000 that was the first health insurance plan to rely upon episodes to define and manage risk. Those initiatives informed the creation of Remedy Partners.

We believe that successful Episode Programs require a high level of cooperation between providers, outstanding technologies to link providers and patients, risk management systems that limit downside in taking episode risk, data analytics capabilities to measure and track care and performance, and financial management systems to manage claims and accurately report results. Remedy focuses on each of these challenges and develops solutions that allow our care teams to succeed.

All of the foundation's grantmaking and advocacy efforts support this mission.

The foundation sets clear priorities because we can have the greatest impact by staying focused. Certain problems affect millions of people: diseases in developing countries, low high school graduation rates in the United States, low crop yields in Africa. In our priority areas, we work on long-term solutions for people with the most urgent needs.

The Gates Foundation makes grants in three program areas: Global Development, Global Health, and the United States. Each program area has a policy and advocacy team dedicated to raising awareness of problems and solutions to motivate change. Their work includes public affairs, to increase interest in the issues and strengthen the voice of the public; grantmaking to organizations that support our mission; and public education, to provide policymakers and others with information on issues.

Our grantmaking process involves four key steps: developing strategy, making grants, measuring progress, and adjusting strategy. Our approach emphasizes partnership, innovation, risk, and, most importantly, results. Achieving the results we want requires the flexibility to learn from mistakes.","","USA","","Seattle","Seattle","","",0,0,"2011-01-01","2013-06-25",2,18,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

HemoSonics, LLC is a privately held medical device company founded to develop and bring to market innovative in vitro diagnostics to characterize hemostasis in a variety of clinical settings. These systems employ a patented approach named sonorheometry (SR), which is faster, easier to use, and has a lower cost than competing technologies.

Our products combine a flexible test device with targeted disposable test chambers to diagnose specific defects of hemostasis and inform appropriate therapy. This approach makes our system easier to operate and interpret than existing products. Potential clinical applications include trauma, cardiovascular procedures, organ transplantation, orthopedic surgery, neurological surgery, and labor and delivery among others.

Sonorheometry was invented by company founders Walker, Viola, and Lawrence while at the University of Virginia. This technology has undergone clinical and laboratory testing supported by a series of academic and business grants from the National Institutes of Health, the Wallace H. Coulter Foundation for Translational Research, the Office of Naval Research, and private investors. Sonorheometry has been demonstrated in a series of peer-reviewed scientific publications and has undergone both laboratory and clinical evaluation. Standalone prototypes are undergoing further clinical and laboratory evaluation.

HemoSonics is located in Charlottesville, Virginia.

In the United States alone, 1.7 million people each year, or 1 out of every 20 patients admitted to U.S. hospitals contract a healthcare-associated infection (HAI). Each of these points of contact is an opportunity to prevent or spread an infectious disease.

nGage, a point-of-care compliance monitoring system, successfully motivates healthcare workers to follow hand hygiene standards through engaging healthcare workers personally and professionally with active messaging.

nGage is a healthcare-specific RFID network solution focused on infection prevention, quality efforts and efficient communication. Other RFID providers are attempting to cross over into healthcare with systems that were developed for retail and manufacturing. The nGage system is expandable to integrate healthcare-specific devices, IT systems, and other applications that use traditional RFID, such as asset tracking, temperature and workflow. Since nGage was initially designed to monitor hand hygiene, the hand hygiene monitoring system is very robust. We have clinical and financial evidence to support the impact nGage and improved hand hygiene has on healthcare.

1/5th of Medicaid spending is impacted by the social needs of patients (food, housing, mental health, etc). However, case managers are understaffed (1:5,000) and rely on paper based workflows, making it tough for plans to address these needs and meet certain quality metrics. 

The Healthify platform addresses these pain points systematically. First, a dynamic screening tool is deployed to assess a patient's social needs and identify who is most at risk. The platform then takes this data and refers patients to the best resources for their needs and automates the follow up process via interactive texts. This information is then relayed back to the case manager in a population dashboard making case management easier.","health-care-information-technology, health--wellness, mobile-health, social--needs, sdoh, managed--care","USA","NY","New York City","New York","","",0,0,"2013-06-01","2013-07-01",2,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Our health care system is focused on illness - identifying it and dealing with it: screening, diagnosing, treating, and hopefully curing. And most people don't pay attention to their health until some sort of illness or crisis arises.

At Health123 we believe there is a better way  tracking, managing, and optimizing wellness. To do that, there are 5 health factors you should not only know but track regularly and do small things to improve in the interval. They are:

1. Weight Control (BMI, WC)
2. Heart Health (Lipid Panel, Heart Risk, Blood Pressure)
3. Nutritional Balance (Diet, Digestion, Blood Sugar)
4. Energy Levels (Vitamin D, Fatigue, TSH, Sleep & Activity Habits)
5. Emotional Wellness (Stress, Anxiety, Depression, Social wellness)


At Health123 we provide tools to generate, understand, and keep track of these essential metrics. More importantly, your stats are built in to a management platform that allows you to identify and make small easy weekly changes to positively impact your results over time. Our behavioral scientists and medical advisors know that the best way to create lasting healthy change is by consistently committing to small things that can easily become habits. Saying you are going to lose 50 pounds or run a marathon can be quite daunting to the average person but committing to a 10-15 minute walk before dinner is not and it can get you on your way to a healthier you. So, come on, join the Health123 movement and take control of your health.","","USA","WA","East  Seattle","TBD","2013-06-27","2013-06-27",1,1016506,"2012-07-10","2012-07-10",1,3,"2013-06-27","venture","partial",1016506,0,1,1

Each year in the United States there are approximately one million patients that try steroid injections to relieve the pain associated with a disc herniation in their lower back.

Minimus Spine believes that it can benefit these patients with a single injection and reduce the number of patients that ultimately need surgery.Minimus Spine is developing ozone injection technology specifically for spinal applications. Ozone has been used to treat disc herniations in Europe for over 15 years and there are over 20 peer-reviewed papers documenting over 8,000 patients.

We have improved upon the existing technology through a system that creates ozone, and measures its concentration, within in a sterile, syringe-cartridge (patents pending). This has advantages in terms of sterility and dose assurance, as well as material compatibility, which are vital to the advancement of this technique.

Minimus will commercialize its product outside the United States and then begin working with FDA to offer this technology in the U.S. This will involve rigorous clinical trials conducted by spine surgeons and interventional radiologists.  The study will seek to confirm that an injection of ozone into a herniated disc is both safe and effective. The results of these trials will be submitted to FDA for marketing approval. Currently, ozone cannot be legally marketed for medical application in the U.S. and FDA has justifiably taken enforcement actions against manufacturers that promote this treatment without FDA approval.

By bringing together PERS, ADL and Biometric Monitoring all on one 2net Platform, Care Technology Systems is offering an unrivaled value proposition that is a win for plans, providers and patients. Based in Nashville, Tennessee, Care Technology Systems has united a range of leading-edge technologies and communications media to help seniors maintain their independence and lifestyle as they age in place. The key to the system is that it has no interface to frustrate the user. Its wireless technology works silently in the background to keep both families and staff informed 24/7 of the senior's lifestyle movements and requires nothing of the senior or patient to perform its role. If there are issues or threats, caregivers close by and far away are immediately notified through various communications channels -- including social media -- and can respond appropriately. A cloud-based system, Qualcomm Life's 2net Platform enables companies, providers and users to capture data from any wireless medical device and deliver it to integrated portals or databases, storing it in a secure and reliable system. Information can be easily retrieved by physicians, caregivers or other critical audiences, such as designated healthcare service companies, providers, payors, pharmaceutical companies and application/device collaborators, for use in healthcare decisions.

DocDox allows doctors to transfer patient care in a way that is JCAHO and ACGME compliant--which most EMR systems don't even do. Physicians typically keep track of their patients in the hospital using a Word document, or if they use EMR, a simple list of patients with names and locations. Neither of these ways is sufficient. 

Doctors need a quick way to manage complex problem lists, medications, and need to be able to quickly reference something that tells them what to follow up, on as many as 30 or 40 patients at a time. The founders knew that to solve this problem, it would also have to save physicians time, and if possible, help them make more money. DocDox does this by putting all the work in the cloud, being constantly accessible, and in a much more user-friendly, comprehensive manner than existing patient management methods.","physician, patient-management, health-care, health-care-information-tecnology","USA","DC","Washington","Washington DC","","",0,0,"2013-09-23","2013-09-23",1,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In addition, Trevena has built an early-stage portfolio of drug discovery programs currently in lead optimization.

G protein coupled receptors are the targets for more than 30% of all currently marketed therapeutics.

The technology license agreement was formalized in FY2011. Dr. Christmans work has developed promising results for the treatment and repair of cardiac tissue damage. A departure from current approaches, this innovation is a hydrogel that treats damaged tissue by providing a restorative scaffold on which new cells can grow. This hydrogel, VentriGel, is made from cardiac connective tissue that is stripped of heart muscle cells through a cleansing process, freeze-dried and milled into powder form, and then liquefied into a fluid that can be easily injected into the heart. Upon reaching body temperature, the liquid turns into a semi-solid, porous gel that encourages cells to repopulate areas of damaged cardiac tissue and to preserve heart function. The hydrogel forms a scaffold to repair the tissue and possibly provides biochemical signals that prevent further deterioration in the surrounding tissues.

The original insight for the technology came during a trip to Senegal in West Africa. The founders observed a Neem tree there, which grows green and healthy year-round in the desert. The question was asked of whether the properties of this tree could be transferred to other plants to improve their growth and health.

Seven years and hundreds of trials later, the answer appears to be that yes, the properties of this amazing tree can be transferred to other applications, with resulting benefits in plant growth, vitality, and yield.

The company has developed hardware and software to measure muscle fitness based on a technique called Electrical Impedance Myography (EIM) developed by Dr. Rutkove and validated through more than a decade of research. 

Using the same EIM technology, Skulpt is now developing the first consumer product optimized to measure muscle and fat composition, as well as muscle quality for individual body parts.

Skulpt Aim provides the percentage of fat and muscle quality for each body part, as soon as the user places Aim to the area of the body they want to measure. It is a portable, wireless device that uses proprietary sensors to apply a small amount of electrical current to each muscle, and analyze thousands of data points per second to give users the most accurate results.

They utilize novel markers of tissue stem/progenitor cells as therapeutic targets. Utilizing tumor xenograft models created with human cancer cell lines, they have tested efficacy of our lead compounds. We have also developed a novel proprietary mouse cancer stem cell line that produces aggressive isograft tumors in immunodeficient mice. These tumors exhibit both epithelial and stromal features and tend to develop early metastases.  We hypothesize that candidate therapeutics active against these isografts are also likely to be effective in human tumors, which share similar features. The ability to generate and isolate tumor-initiating cells has enabled COARE to accurately predict the response of these cells to investigational compounds, either alone or in combination. These studies have given COARE the unique opportunity to assess the importance of specific target proteins and RNAs in both animal and human cancers. Furthermore this research approach has uncovered novel regulatory mechanisms associated with biological pathways that control cancer stem cell fate and plasticity. In addition to our proprietary siRNA mediated delivery platform, COARE is also developing panels of monoclonal antibodies against key stem cell signaling molecules expressed in tumor initiating cells. COAREs continued dedication to advancing the science of stem cell biology has lead to an extensive pipeline of agents targeting multiple pathways and designed to eventually eradicate solid tumor cancer morbidity and mortality with the hope of ending the suffering of patients and families worldwide.

BiOptix Inc., established in 2008 and located in Boulder, Colorado, is a venture-funded company with previous investment rounds led by Boulder Ventures and Rusnano, respectively.
The companys mission is to develop its proprietary E-SPR (Enhanced Surface Plasmon Resonance) technology platform for the detection of molecular interactions. The BiOptix product line has been designed to address the increasing demand for high-throughput, high performance label-free instrumentation with the capability to perform an expanded range of scientific applications.  Applications include:  kinetic rate determination, fragment screening, epitope mapping and affinity measurement.  
Technology
Surface Plasmon Resonance is an advanced and highly sensitive optical technology that can measure refractive index changes on a sensor chips gold surface due to a change in mass that occurs during a binding event. This change can be used to monitor biological interactions such as the concentration of target molecules, kinetic rates and affinity constants. BiOptix has developed a novel ultra-sensitive detection platform known as Enhanced Surface Plasmon Resonance (E-SPR). E-SPR or phase-based SPR differs from standard surface plasmon resonance detection methods in that it combines the high sensitivity of SPR with the high stability and lower noise of common path interferometry.
Products
In 2010, BiOptix introduced the economical 104sa, which is and remains the first commercial instrument to employ phase-based SPR technology. The 104sa has a single flow cell design with a quad array of sensors and includes a powerful and user-friendly software package for instrument control and data analysis. In 2012, BiOptix will launch the 404pi which also utilizes E-SPR technology. This new class of instrumentation brings increased sensitivity, flexibility and the ability to measure protein-small molecule interactions (100 Da) in a high-throughput 96/386 well platform that utilizes 4 parallel channels rather than a single flow cell. The BiOptix 404pi is an affordable and more powerful solution for scientists that require rapid, label-free, real-time detection of biomolecular interactions with a reasonable cost to own and operate. At BiOptix we actively work with customers to help develop custom protocols and specialty chips that meet and exceed unique and individual research needs.

GliaCure was founded in 2011 and is based on discoveries by its scientific founder, Philip Haydon, Ph.D., of Tufts University. Professor Haydon has partnered with Michael Szulczewski, who successfully co-founded the imaging company Prairie Technologies, Inc. Their complementary skills in academia and industry provide a solid basis for success in this new venture.

It is known that the brain consists of two types of cells - neurons and glia. Much of the research of the last century has focused on neurons. Philip Haydons recent work has identified a novel glia-based target that, in pre-clinical studies, is highly efficacious in reversing Alzheimers disease. GliaCure will initially exploit this opportunity to develop novel small molecule pharmaceuticals for the treatment of Alzheimers disease, a disorder that, it is estimated, will cost the US $1.1 trillion annually by 2050. GliaCure will also focus on discovering and developing related glia-targeted pharmaceuticals to treat other disorders such as traumatic brain injury, Down Syndrome, Parkinsons disease, glioblastoma, neuropathic pain, epilepsy, psychiatric and sleep disorders","","USA","WI","MIDDLETON","Middleton","2012-02-17","2012-02-17",1,1000000,"","",0,2,"2012-02-17","venture","partial",1000000,0,1,1

Together they opened BioDigital Systems  a biomedical visualization company  in New York City, and over the years, they have helped make biomedical information more accessible for a diverse list of clients, including hospitals, biotech and medical device companies, pharmaceuticals, non-profit organizations, and academic institutions.

The reactions to BioDigital's 3D storytelling  from patients, physicians, healthcare providers, and educators - were so positive that in 2010, BioDigital decided to expand their technology to empower anyone with Internet access to learn about the human body - in a way that resembles life itself. A year later, the BioDigital Human was born. This interactive, medically accurate virtual body enables users to study anatomy, disease, and treatments.

Rx Cost Containment is a specialty company that provides required independent acute/ chronic toxicology screening for patients / injured workers on opioid medications, as well as educational services, direct interface with Employers, the Insurance Industry, Third Party Administrators, and Self Insured Employers. We also work directly with physician offices and clinics. We are unique in that we work to provide independent toxicology screening (drug testing) as neutral collection sites away from doctors' offices at over 2,100 sites nationwide.

Toxicology diagnostics is rapidly growing niche business in the ""Acute/ Chronic Pain Management Care"" segment of the healthcare industry, including pain management arenas within the workers' compensation and personal injury markets. The increase in opioid scripting, partly in response to demand for, and use of, Schedule II drugs by the public at large, has created a significant increase in the cost of claims. Per evidence based medicine, drug screening by urinalysis, is a component of pain management therapy when opioids are involved.

Physicians are profiting from toxicology either directly or indirectly, in ways substantially identical to the manner in which they profit from dispensing medication.

We have the answers to independent required toxicology testing for pain management as outlined in evidence based medicine, ACOEM and ODG Guidelines, California MTUS, AMA Guidelines and specific state rules and regulations.

Teethsavers is an organization dedicated to caring for the children of developing countries and their teeth and thereby improving their overall health. Our plan is to educate people,with a high school diploma, in Teethsavers one year school, in developing countries - that can then care for and educate their own people. 

The vast numbers of children unable to receive any sort of oral health care in these countries is overwhelming. New techniques of providing oral health care and new methods of education of oral hygiene, have been developed by Teethsavers to facilitate these goals in the absence of normal dental equipment. 

The tooth filling, advocated by the World Health Organization (WHO) Atraumatic Restorative Treatment (ART) was developed by Dr. Jo Frencken, MSc, DDS, PhD, the Netherlands during 14 years in Africa and was International Dentist of 1999. Dr. Frencken has been my main consultant since 2000. Graduates of our school in Zambia, Nicaragua, Malawi and Sierra Leone are registered by each countries Medical and Dental Council. 

Our organization is the only one teaching full-time ART procedures, no electricity needed and teaching oral hygiene at the children primary school, including mothers and school teacher workshop. We are the fourth category dental school that too many in the world do not know about  Yet. 

Easy to move wooden apparatus is locally made and the uniqueness of the apparatus is its simplicity: the child lies on the wooden bench with hers/his head in the lap of the operator while the dental assistant using a wooden table and stool, passes instruments and material in modern four-handed dentistry in a virtually painless process at the patients school. No Tears, No Fears. 

Mothers are taught to start daily oral hygiene at age three months (cloth around finger, carefully) and child looking at a picture book, if she cannot read, to develop the child's curiosity. One mother, more literate, teaches the other mothers and follows-up weekly.  

Graduates, following the supervised six months field practical, can have a low fee private practice or work for their government.

Tooth decay is the most prevalent childhood disease (bacterial infection) in the world.

The purpose of the Mx:Scale Project, demonstrate a regulated and professionalized Oregon Medical Marijuana Program using best practices successful throughout medicinal research/discovery, engineering and agriculture. Expecting performance from the OMMP, the project incorporates an evidence-based reform pro-actively fulfilling law enforcement objectives and establishes a productive engagement with the medical community.

The Mx:Scale communicates a patients required and a cultivators intended medicinal effects via an Mx:Key, Mx. The Mx outlines an Activity level and four essential effects. Utilizing a succinct basis, the Mx:Scale Project initiates communication channels networking evidence and data among stakeholders  patients, cultivators, physicians, service professionals, researchers, enforcement, and legislative decision makers  as they need them.

The Mx:Scale Project is a professionalized medical marijuana endeavor employing a tools suite and services to educate and interface the principals of a legitimate medical marijuana program. The project networks components together, establishing a standardized language and process. Primary channels identify, tutor, and encourage Oregons Good-actors by expecting the highest benefit and value for Patients while acknowledging the solutions Cultivators develop.

The core research analyzes a patients complex health requirements -- Health Concerns; Medicinal and Relief Requirements; Time of Day/Month Issues; Health Program; Prescription Regime; and quantifies Special Comorbidity challenges  Mx:Demand. The project creates a comparison between patient requirements and certified Cultivator medicinal solutions  Garden environment, Genetic, and Cost+ Certification; Chemical and Foodweb Assay; and Materials Testing  important aggregates within the Statistical Effects evaluation. 

Synchronized data relates Patient Requirements v. Medicinals available by correlating solutions  Mx:Matrix predictive database. Finalizing the analysis, the project incorporates a comprehensive Patient Outcome Analysis Program, POAP, to report comparative health metrics, savings and long-term results. These metrics compare the Patient load taxing available Physician and Specialist Hours; Capital Equipment and Procedures Bottlenecks; Required Prescriptions; and Overall Cost to State and Federal Healthcare Dollars  before and after a Patients participation in the OMMP program.

The Patient Channel consults OMMP Patients on effects, and the scope of benefit medicinal marijuana may provide, using assessment tools, identifying program requirements. The Mx:Intake tool documents Patient health conditions and creates symptom-condition-priority targets-for-mitigation customizing medicinal marijuana regimens. This tool integrates details to enhance the precision of the appraisal data  time of day/month, dosing, and relief. Customized reports embolden patients communicating their genuine health objectives among their own program support entities. Consolidating intake data empowers an effects based demand that directs medicinal garden development, reducing overage, liability, and eliminates medicinals diverted to illicit markets. OMMP Patient Mx:Supply v. Mx:Demand is optimized applying real-time matching, coordinating a weighted effects forecast against certified availability. Facilitating a Patient-Physician dialog; the Patient Channel legitimizes current screening processes.

The Patient Channel
o Usurps illicit markets because Patient demand for performance medicinals is unsatisfied by erroneous commodity offerings. A technology basis creates personalized expectations and delivers consistent highly beneficial relief.
o Establishes the foundation for evidence-based reform; engaging Oregons medical community with expectations, metrics and quantifiable outcomes.

The Physician Channel expedites comparative metrics compiled from robust medicinal marijuana programs generating medical impact data. Utilizing the POAP tool, Physicians assess medicinal marijuana as components within a larger effective patient health program and verify their evidence-based assessment. POAP metrics report Outcome; Resource-Impact; Program Efficacy; and generate a Comparative Financial Analysis for healthcare programs. Reporting Program Dollars and Diagnostic-Equipment Loads the POAP accounts for efficacy and ROI benefits attributed to the OMMP. The POAP illuminates overall and objective evidence for patients under physician care; integrating professional medical opinions with comprehensive assessment data.

The Physician Channel
o Drives evidence-based reform data; empowering the physician community with medicinally derived expectations, performance metrics, and certified evidence-based patient outcomes.
oEnjoins Physician expertise with technology-type expectations when marijuana is utilized applicably as a medicinal.

The Cultivator channel administrates the garden audit; cost certification; medicinal forecast; genetic certification library; materials testing; custody and patient feedback for cultivator strains, Mx:Solutions. A patients medicinal effects and assessment derive from exclusive Plant Chemistries collaborating with their own personal Biochemistry. The exclusive Plant Chemistries derive from genetic predispositions and a Cultivators specific environment, response process, application schedule, and special augmentations. The Channel tutors Cultivators and aligns their direction with Patient Medicinal Targets; solving patient Mx:Demand v. Mx:Supply discrepancy using the real-time Mx:Gap analysis and Mx:Forecast reports. The channel ultimately facilitates patient access to personalized catalogs of available medicinals statistically matched to health conditions and corresponding alternatives to mitigate tolerance escalation  optimizing dose schedules. Incorporating Patient-Physician channel results, Mx:Demand reports produce medicinal effects targets for cultivators intentionally improving their Solutions Stable. Mx:Solution development means conscious competence, intentional propagation, and optimized medicinals.

The Cultivator Channel
o Directs Mx:Solution Registration; Testing; Custody; and Assays. 
o Documents Cultivator Mx:Solutions and their Intended Effects recognized, evidenced, and certified within the Mx:Patient and Mx:Physician channels. Coalescing patient strain assessments with discrete cannabinoid assay, it validates predictive evidence within the Mx:Matrix data set.

The Professional Services Channel logistically manage available Mx:Supply by Effect; Demand; Health Concern, Relief and Priority Requirements  establishing legitimate Supply-chain Metrics, Forecast and Gap analysis. The channel utilizes a Solutions database that includes education, assessment and consulting tools to create a robust technology platform showcasing stakeholders demonstrating germane competencies. The Mx:Scale Project delivers vital metrics for evidence-based reform and drives Patient-centric value-added services.
?
The Professional Services Channel
o Manages Patient Relationships
 By Route, Application and Dosing Parameters
 By Region, Demographic, Health-Concern, and Expectations, etc.
 By Stakeholder, Tools and Real-time Demand

The Legislator Channel provides an executive vantage over the working Mx:Scale Project. Real-time HUD reports summarize medical, financial and health resource data for decision makers while demonstrating how healthy medicinal marijuana programs perform. The channel replaces the Opinion vs. Opinion volley taxing elected leaders who lack evidence-based programs and substantive data. The Channel illuminates engagement with Oregons medical communities and Best-Practice solutions to enforcement objectives. The channel demonstrates answers, as Elected Decision Makers need them. It includes a Frequently Asked Question Library; Real-time reports; on-demand iConference; and Progress Reporting. Accessed by authorized users maintains a direct as needed connection with the program. The channel encourages pro-active input as the project expands.

The Legislator Channel
o Supports evidence-based reform, pro-actively satisfying law enforcement objectives and provides evidence of the improved engagement with Oregons medical community.

Marijuana is a technology, capable of medicinal expectations. The Mx:Scale Project employs tools quantifying patients and solutions using a effects based language to create an robust system. The Mx:Scale clarifies, classifies and communicates the effects of marijuana for medicinal purposes. The Project drives a scientific template for a regulated and professionalized Oregon Medical Marijuana Program using best practices successful throughout medicinal research/discovery, engineering and agriculture. Our project expects more from the OMMP by creating an evidence-based reform tool and pro-actively satisfying law enforcement objectives while providing a productive engagement with Oregons medical community.
MxResearch is committed to partnering with entities to uncover these truths and remove marijuana from the shroud inhibiting positive impact on OMMP patient populations who require the technologies delivered via the highly effective medical biomass.

You can enjoy a natural hot tub experience without sitting in a chemical soup. The Natural Solution products and Rainbow Rocks are all natural and 100% bio-based, manufactured in an eco-responsible manner.

My family and I have been using The Natural Solution products for many years and believe it's the best natural spa and hot tub cleaner on the market. Rainbow Rocks are the hottest selling, most innovative fragrance product to hit the market in years.

We started using The Natural Solution for Hot Tubs because my wife was having adverse skin reactions to the hot tub chlorine and bromine I was using. She would get out of the tub with red, irritated and itchy skin. We began the search for a natural hot tub chemical alternative .

When we found The Natural Solution, I was skeptical at first but after getting in the spa the first time, I was excited! There was no chemical smell and it was like sitting in a nice warm bath. After my wife got out of the hot tub, her skin was soft and smooth, not dry and itchy. I was a believer! We've been using The Natural Solution ever since. It was so easy to use and the tub was so clean, clear, and soft, I decided to start selling it.

Now that I am telling the world about natural hot tub products and The Natural Solution I hope that you will have the same great experience that we've had. Why not share your experiences with family and friends and refer them to our on-line store for our entire line of spa chemical alternatives. I know they will Love it!!!

The companyâs lead candidate, CMX001, is being developed as a potential broad spectrum antiviral agent for the treatment of life-threatening double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viral diseases. Over 350 people have received CMX001 to date, with a growing body of evidence supporting the drugâs antiviral activity in humans.

Clinical studies of CMX001 include an ongoing Phase 2 study of the prevention/control of cytomegalovirus (CMV) in hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients (CMX001-201), a Phase 2 study being initiated for the treatment of adenovirus (AdV) infection in pediatric and adult hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients (CMX001-202), and an Open-Label Study (CMX001-350) for the treatment of any of 12 different dsDNA viral infections, including AdV, herpes viruses such as CMV, herpes simplex virus and Epstein Barr virus, polyoma viruses such as BK virus and JC virus, and pox viruses. The Open-Label Study builds on Chimerixâs extensive experience working with clinicians at over 55 leading institutions in the United States, Canada, Europe and Israel who have sought CMX001 for the treatment of more than 150 immunocompromised patients under Emergency INDs. CMX001 has been well tolerated in all studies.

CMX001 is also being developed as a medical countermeasure in the event of a smallpox release. Chimerix has received significant federal funding for the development of CMX001 as a medical countermeasure against smallpox from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

Chimerixâs second clinical-stage antiviral compound, CMX157, a potent nucleoside analogue with in vitro activity against HIV and hepatitis B, has the potential to directly address several limitations of current HIV therapies. Chimerix is developing CMX157 for the treatment of HIV infection including those caused by multi-drug resistant viruses. A Phase 1 clinical study has been completed demonstrating that the compound is well tolerated and that the active antiviral, TFV-PP, was measurable in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) after a single dose and remained detectable for six days, indicating that it may be suitable for once-weekly dosing.

The company has developed diagnostic kits for breast, colon, ovarian, and prostate cancers, and markets diagnostic kits in Europe for the detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in patients with breast and colon cancer. Product and Product Candidate Pipeline The companyâs portfolio of compounds and technologies under development or planned development include: AdnaGen Oncology Diagnostics; A Liposomal TS Inhibitor; Cordycepin; L-Nucleoside Conjugates; and Novel Tubulin Isotype-Specific Anti-Mitotics. AdnaGen Diagnostic Products The company's subsidiary, AdnaGen A.G., offers diagnostic products for colon and breast cancer diagnosis in the European market. It has the ability to detect and recognize the expression of tumor-associated biomarkers in patients with metastatic cancer. In September 2008, AdnaGen entered into a distribution and license agreement with Biomarkers LLC (Biomarkers) granting Biomarkers the right to distribute the AdnaGen diagnostic kits in North America. AdnaGen also entered into a distribution and license agreement with Biomarkers granting Biomarkers the right to distribute the AdnaGen diagnostic kits in South America and the Middle East. In January 2007, AdnaGen entered into a distribution agreement with Innogenetics N.V. (Innogenetics) granting Innogenetics the right to commercialize the AdnaGen diagnostic kits in the European market. In September 2007, AdnaGen entered into a license agreement with Innogenetics granting Innogenetics the right to use AdnaGen technology in adapting Innogeneticsâ proprietary strip detection technology after successful feasibility studies. Liposomal Thymidylate Synthase (TS) Inhibitor (OVI-237) (solid tumors) OVI-237 is the companyâs advanced clinical stage drug. OVI-237 is a liposome encapsulated formulation of a potent thymidylate synthase inhibitor (TSI) with activity at picomolar concentrations. It was obtained as a result of a worldwide licensing agreement with OSI Pharmaceuticals (Melville, New York). With OVI-237, it has finalized the protocol and selected clinical sites to conduct a Phase II Study of OVI-237 monotherapy and combination therapy with cisplatin for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Cordycepin (OVI-123) (TdT-Positive Refractory Leukemias) The company is developing Cordycepin as a treatment option for certain leukemia patients that are either refractory to chemotherapeutics or have experienced a relapse. Cordycepin depends upon the presence of a DNA polymerase, known as terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), for its therapeutic activity. Cordycepin has been studied in a National Cancer Institute-sponsored Phase I clinical trial for treating TdT-positive ALL leukemia patients. It initiated a Phase I/II trial based on the âoriginalâ ADA-sensitive compound. L-Nucleoside Conjugate (OVI-117): The company has accumulated in vitro and in vivo data indicating that the L-nucleoside conjugates are effective against various types of cancer. One of its L-nucleoside conjugate candidates, OVI-117, is a conjugate of an L-nucleoside (L-uridine) and the highly toxic compound 5â-fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP), a thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibitor. Tubulin Isotype-Specific Anti-mitotics The companyâs other platform technology relates to a proprietary database of tubulin isotypes as potential candidates for targeting by certain chemotherapeutics. It is evaluating various candidates as part of its research and development in this area. Collaborative Relationships and Partnerships The company has relationships with the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UTHSCSA), the Cancer Therapy and Research Center (CTRC), the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, MD Anderson Cancer Center and the San Antonio Cancer Institute (SACI), a cancer research institute.

Galectin Therapeutics uses naturally occurring carbohydrate polymers with galactose residues to create complex carbohydrates with specific molecular weights. Using these unique carbohydrate-based candidate compounds that bind and inhibit galectin proteins, we are pursuing therapies for indications where galectins have a demonstrated role in the pathogenesis of a particular disease. We focus on diseases with serious, life threatening consequences to patients, and those where current treatment options are limited. Our strategy is to establish clinical development approaches that add value to the Company in the shortest time possible, and to seek partners as the program advances and requires much greater resources.

Galectin Therapeutics leverages extensive scientific and development expertise as well as established relationships with outside sources to achieve cost effective and efficient development. We are pursuing a clear development pathway to clinical enhancement and commercialization for our lead compounds in liver fibrosis and cancer immunotherapy.

Speech Buddies are handheld devices that accelerate learning with the hardest problem sounds: R, S, CH, L, and SH.  Schools, parents, speech therapists, and children all use Speech Buddies because they can cut the amount of time it takes to treat a speaking disorder in half.  Prior to Speech Buddies, speech therapists used items like coffee stirrers and peanut butter to try and achieve their clinical goals.

Speech Buddies work by providing targets inside the mouth for children to feel correct tongue placement when attempting to pronounce problem sounds. Speech Buddies can help children turn their âwabbitsâ into ârabbitsâ, âwessonsâ into âlessonsâ, and âthocksâ into âsocksâ. This tactile feedback within the mouth is often just what kids need to achieve learning breakthroughs.

Speech Buddies are FDA listed and are made in California at a registered medical device facility. Our clinical standards are the most rigorous in the industry. The INTACT (Intra Oral Tactile Bio-Feedback) study, a single blind, randomized and controlled study, is one of several research initiatives underway to demonstrate the effectiveness of Speech Buddies.

Adnectins are proteins designed to either block or stimulate therapeutic targets of interest to fight diseases across a broad range of therapeutic areas. Their proprietary technology for engineering these versatile proteins creates an opportunity to rapidly generate highly differentiated medicines.

Adnexus, a Bristol-Myers Squibb R&D Company, is a leader in the discovery and development of Adnectins, a proprietary type of targeted biologic. Adnectins are proteins designed to either block or stimulate therapeutic targets of interest to help fight diseases across a broad range of therapeutic areas. Our proprietary technology for engineering these proteins creates an opportunity to rapidly generate compounds for study as potential treatment options for patients.

Targeted biologics are one of the most medically important and fastest growing areas in the biopharmaceutical industry. These drugs are specifically designed to attack targets of disease. Despite the success of the first generation targeted therapeutic products, such as antibodies, additional innovations are sought by the medical community to help meet unmet needs for improved safety, and efficacy. We believe the study of Adnectins can help to address these demands.

Adnectins are derived from human fibronectin, an abundant extracellular protein that binds naturally to a number of different proteins. We create Adnectins using our proprietary protein engineering system called PROfusion. Our scientists can rapidly create PROfusion libraries of more than 10 trillion different Adnectins. We then screen these libraries to identify Adnectins with the desired drug properties against therapeutic targets of interest. PROfusion enables discovery productivity by minimizing the timeframe for identifying high-quality candidates.

In October 2007, Adnexus was acquired by Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. This acquisition has further accelerated our growth as an industry leader in the discovery and early development of proprietary targeted biologics. Together with Bristol-Myers Squibb, we are developing multiple Adnectin programs for use in the study of potential treatments in a broad range of disease types, including oncology, immunology, and cardiovascular disease.","","USA","MA","Waltham","Boston","2006-06-26","2007-08-07",2,42500000,"2007-09-24","2013-01-01",2,2,"2007-08-07","series-c+","c",15500000,5,1,0

Silicone used as a membrane has fantastic properties. It can transfer gas to or from a liquid without leaking--like human bodies do inside the lungs, where oxygen transfers into blood while carbon dioxide leaves the blood and is exhaled. Some researchers use silicone membranes to grow cells or medicines, others to prepare samples for analysis in sophisticated equipment.

Since 2000, MedArray has been developing the technology with the support of the US National Institutes of Health, through a grant program that has provided $4M to the company. In 2009, MedArray began selling its membranes to companies and research centers commercially.","medical-device, oxygenation, artificial-lung, scientific-equipment, separation","USA","MI","Ann Arbor","Detroit","","",0,0,"2009-01-01","2009-01-01",1,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Barrettâs is a precancerous condition of the lining of the esophagus (swallowing tube) caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD. The companyâs HALOFLEX, HALO360 and HALO90  ablation systems are designed to provide a uniform and controlled ablation effect, in order to remove diseased tissue and allow re-growth of normal cells.

A multi-center randomized, sham-controlled study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2009, studied HALO radiofrequency ablation applied in the highest risk Barrettâs population (those having dysplasia). The ablation group had a high rate of complete eradication of dysplasia and intestinal metaplasia and a significantly decreased rate of disease progression and cancer development, as compared to the control group. In another study (AIM-II) published in Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, 98.4% of treated patients were Barrettâs-free after two and a half years of follow-up.

The HALO systems are cleared by the FDA for use in the United States and each have CE Mark for use in Europe. More than 58,000 procedures have been performed in over 400 hospitals around the world.

ADispell research has revealed a novel mechanism that explains the onset of cognition loss and has discovered and validated lead compounds through in vivo experiments that interact favorably with the mechanism. The Company has performed successful laboratory work and has a scientific plan to make the technology attractive to the pharmaceutical industry for licensing. 
ADispell operates a âlicense in - add value â license outâ model that will result in a much faster investment payback than other pharmaceutical projects. This payback structure is based on licensing fees, milestone payments, and royalties from product sales. The business has completed technology licensing from Cornell University and expects substantial income during the next three years, which will produce an attractive, rapid investment return. 
The experienced ADispell management team will take the promising technology, patented by Cornell, and advance it into a robust development of interest to one or more âbig pharmaâ companies, by proceeding through the middle, formative stages of the pharmaceutical drug development process, and then executing a license with a pharma development company. The licensing company is expected to develop at least one blockbuster drug for memory loss by completing the clinical trial stage of this process. This three-year ADispell project will proceed with investor and grant support in the first year and then with funding from pharmaceutical partners during years two and three. At least one significant payment event is expected at the end of three years as a pharma company licenses the technology for clinical trial and final development for sale. ADispell expects to stay involved with the project in an ongoing development role during this time. Longer term income (after 7 to 9 years) includes royalty payments based on the blockbuster drug sales with development milestone payments occurring in the time between these two payment periods. Additional treatments for other neurological diseases are very possible, resulting in parallel revenue streams. The project offers other product (and license) opportunities such as biomarkers to identify the onset or presence of AD (another unmet need) as well as the possibility to produce more than one drug compound for AD and dementia disorders.","upstate-ny, biotech, blockbuster-drug, compounds, cognitive-disorders","USA","NY","Rochester","Rochester","","",0,0,"","",0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

CB is comprised of institutional investors, venture capitalists, sell side analysts, investment bankers and company management.   Members can track upcoming events and conferences, while leveraging CBâs platform for business development, due-diligence, and investor relations purposes.

Key features:
Â·         Conference Connect
List of companies attending a conference / event, either to present or attend.   Companies will be automatically added to events as they are announced, but company members can manually add themselves to any conference. CB members will not only be able to see the full list of companies presenting or attending, but will also be able to directly request meetings with company representatives who are members of the site. This feature can assist with business development, investor outreach, and relationship building.

Â·         Track-It
If you are interested in a particular company use this feature to help you follow which conferences they will be at. Track-It will send you a real time update when a company is added to a conference. You will then be able to request a meeting with attending company representatives.

Â·         Event Calendar
This is a comprehensive list of upcoming events.  CB members also have the ability to make additions, including R&D or Analyst Dayâs, Annual Meetings, and scientific presentations. Members can also link documents to these events, such as a corporate presentation, company factsheet or posters.

Â·         Company Database Search 
Search our database of companies for general information.  CB currently has information on over 18,000 companies.

Â·         Trip Locator
Members can join events, and manually add trips, to discover business opportunities with fellow colleagues traveling to the same conference or city. When you RSVP to a conference, or add your trip to the CB network, the system will inform you of anyone within your network that will be in that particular city. Additionally, under the âNew Business Opportunityâ tab, you can find others outside your direct network in the same city as you.

Â·         Daily News & Blogs & Twitter
We have several providers giving CB unique daily content for the site.  

 Â·         Task Control / Personal Notes
Add a personal note to virtually any entry within ConnectBiotech. Throughout the site, you will find notepad icons to help keep track of your thoughts, ideas and comments. In Personal Notes, all entries are completely private and only viewable by you. Whether you want to remind yourself to attend an event next year or to contact a new CB connection, your Personal Notes are a great resource to keep all your thoughts in one easy-to-use location.

 Â·         Job Listings
Post your own and search listings from other CB members.  

 Â·         Special Member Benefits

30 million people in the U.S. suffer discomfort and sleep loss due to Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS). Sufferers spend $1.5B for relatively ineffective treatments that produce side effects of nausea and vomiting. These treatments lose effectiveness over time and can make the condition worse. TranquilMedâs new product RestEasyâ¢ is the first treatment with no side effects available to RLS sufferers.

We have conducted studies at BYU that show 52% reduction in RLS symptoms in only 12 treatments. These studies have been accepted for publication in peer reviewed medical journals.","rls-treatment, restless-leg-treatment","USA","UT","Provo","Salt Lake City","2010-04-05","2010-04-05",1,27000,"2010-05-01","2010-05-01",1,2,"2010-04-05","other","grant",27000,0,1,1

It was formed in October 2006 through the merger of several affiliated and legacy organizations â The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) and The Center for the Advancement of Genomics (TCAG), The J. Craig Venter Science Foundation, The Joint Technology Center, and the Institute for Biological Energy Alternatives (IBEA). Today all these organizations have become one large multidisciplinary genomic-focused organization. With more than 400 scientists and staff, more than 250,000 square feet of laboratory space, and locations in Rockville, Maryland and San Diego, California.

For more than two decades Dr. J. Craig Venter and his research teams have been pioneers in genomic research. The revolution began in 1991 when at the National Institutes of Health Dr. Venter and his team developed expressed sequence tags (ESTs), a new technique to rapidly discover genes. Dr. Venter and his colleagues then started a new kind of not for profit research institute, The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR). With the freedom to pursue any number of exciting avenues in the burgeoning field of genomics, the team decided to use their new computing and computational tools, as well as new DNA sequencing technology, to sequence the first free living organism, Haemophilus influenzae in 1995. With this advance, the floodgates of genomics were opened. TIGR went on to sequence and analyze more than 50 microbial genomes. Dr. Venter and some from his team moved into mammalian genomics and sequenced some of the most important model organisms including the fruit fly, mouse and rat. The worldâs attention was perhaps most keenly focused on the sequencing and analysis of one genome â the human â which was published in 2001 by Dr. Venter and his team at Celera Genomics.

In the past three years teams have been engaged in some of the most fruitful and exciting research in the biological sciences. Weâve recently published the first diploid human genome and the initial results of our global ocean sampling expedition which uncovered more than six million new genes and thousands of new protein families from organisms found in sea water. Teams have also sequenced the microbial flora found in human environments such as the vagina, oral cavity and human gut. Weâre making steady progress in our quest to create a synthetic chromosome and organism having successfully transformed one species of bacteria into another. Weâve also sequenced a variety of important infectious disease agents such as the mosquito species, Aedes aegypti, and we are working to understand the evolution of several viral genomes such as influenza and coronavirus in our quest to help alleviate the scourge of infectious disease around the world.","sequencing, genomics, bioinformatics, synthetic-biology, bioenergy, infectious-disease, metagenomics, not-for-profit","USA","MD","Rockville","Washington DC","2013-09-18","2013-09-18",1,2400000,"2006-10-01","2006-10-01",1,6,"2013-09-18","other","grant",2400000,1,1,1

With the service, patients avoid the hassle of waiting on hold, searching for a good doctor or wondering whether a doctor takes a particular insurance. Participating health practitioners benefit by attracting new patients and alleviating the productivity lost from last minute cancellations.

In 2012, ZocDoc introduced its first major product since the companys inception - ZocDoc Check-In. This feature allows patients to fill out their medical forms online in advance of their visit and saves the information for future visits as well. This capability, which was the #1 most requested feature to date, improves accuracy and convenience for patients and doctors alike.

In August 2013, ZocDoc introduced the ZocDoc Health Marketplace Resource  a destination providing patients with independent information and analysis of the Health Insurance Marketplaces created under the Affordable Care Act, helping them make more informed healthcare choices. The resources most prominent feature - Care Access Grades  are letter grades assigned to each health insurer that indicate how easy it will be for patients to secure near-term appointments with in-network medical providers.
